# WordCloudProject
This is a Java based project to generate word clouds from a text file. Generating a word cloud from user-inputted text deepened my understanding of Java programming. The 
process of developing the program involved using various data structures such as sorted lists, maps, and keys, which allowed me to practice and refine my skills in data 
manipulation and algorithms. Through this project, I was able to learn how to turn abstract concepts into concrete, working programs

### Prerequisites
Java 8 or higher

### Running the Program
1. Download and compile the repository
2. Compile and run the Menu.java file
3. Follow the options on the Menu switch cases to choose file and the number of words
