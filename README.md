# WordCloudProject
This is a Java based project to generate word clouds from a text file. The program reads the file line by line, counts the frequency of each word, and adds the most common words to a new file. Then it generates a word cloud based on the frequency of the words in that file. A file has been added to ignore words that are common and should be ignored.
